Some of the requirements based on older version of Azure services, that were deprecated.
For instance interaction with API for documents recognition is changes in compare with, how it was described in the course. So are web interfaces for labeling etc.
There were multiple errors, when I attempted to use code as was described in the course.
Azure Video Indexer doesn't support face recognition in videos anymore, so I had to skip this part of the project.
Provision of service consumption report is not possible, as cloud labs gets deleted after certain period of time.
